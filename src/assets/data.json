When measuring what students have learned in a course, especially hands-on skills, it is important for the nurse educator to ensure that the learning objectives are clear and the assessment methods valid and reliable. In this context, having the students actually perform intramuscular injections on elderly patients is the most appropriate measure of their skill. If it is not feasible to have access to actual patients, a suitable alternative would be to demonstrate this skill in a simulation laboratory. Asking the students to explain pharmacokinetics or the rationale behind the technique will not sufficiently assess their practical ability to administer the injections accurately."
